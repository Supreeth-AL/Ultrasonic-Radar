The ultrasonic radar system is a compact and efficient device designed to detect objects and measure their distance and direction in real time. It consists of an ultrasonic sensor, which emits sound waves and measures the time taken for the waves to bounce back from an object, an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller to process the data, and a servo motor to rotate the sensor, enabling 360-degree scanning.

The system is programmed in C using the Arduino IDE, ensuring smooth communication between the components. Additionally, Processing software is utilized to create a graphical user interface (GUI), providing a visual representation of the radar's readings on a screen. This interface displays the object's position and distance, making the system intuitive and user-friendly.

The ultrasonic radar demonstrates versatility and can be applied in fields such as robotics, security systems, and automation, where real-time object detection and monitoring are essential. Its design emphasizes accuracy, reliability, and simplicity, making it an excellent project for showcasing technical skills and innovation.
